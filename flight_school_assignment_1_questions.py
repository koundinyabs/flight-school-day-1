# MAGIC # Flight School Assignment 1
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ## Build a demo
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __*Welcome to Flight School!*__
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this assignment, you'll be working with Delta Lake in batch mode.  You will ingest data, cleanse it, and aggregate it, using patterns that are common in a Bronze-Silver-Gold data lake paradigm.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this notebook, we have structured a demo for you.  Some cells are functional, while others require you to enter code.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __NOTE:__ Use a cluster running Databricks 7.3 ML or higher.

# COMMAND ----------

# This creates the "team_name" field displayed at the top of the notebook.

dbutils.widgets.text("team_name", "Enter your team's name");

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/billkellett/flight-school-resources/blob/master/images/stop.png?raw=true" width=100/> 
# MAGIC ### Before you begin...
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC There are two important bits of housekeeping that are required in order to run this workshop:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __First, enter your Team Name__ in the "team_name" field at the top of the notebook.  We use this when naming resources, to ensure that your database name and file paths do not conflict with other Flight School teams. 
# MAGIC - __Second, run the cell below__ in order to set up your data sources and Delta database for this assignment.
# MAGIC   - To run a cell, click in the cell, then click the triangle on the upper right of the cell and choose "Run Cell" - alternatively, you can use SHIFT+ENTER.

# COMMAND ----------

# Note that we have factored out the setup processing into a different notebook, which we call here.
# As a flight school student, you will probably want to look at the setup notebook.  
# Even though you'll want to look at it, we separated it out in order to demonstrate a best practice... 
# ... you can use this technique to keep your demos shorter, and avoid boring your audience with housekeeping.
# In addition, you can save demo time by running this initial setup command before you begin your demo.

# This cell should run in a few minutes or less

team_name = dbutils.widgets.get("team_name")

setup_responses = dbutils.notebook.run("./includes/flight_school_assignment_1_setup", 0, {"team_name": team_name}).split()

local_data_path = setup_responses[0]
dbfs_data_path = setup_responses[1]
database_name = setup_responses[2]

print(f"Path to be used for Local Files: {local_data_path}")
print(f"Path to be used for DBFS Files: {dbfs_data_path}")
print(f"Database Name: {database_name}")

# COMMAND ----------

# Let's set the default database name so we don't have to specify it on every query

spark.sql(f"USE {database_name}")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Bringing data into a dataframe
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The use case we will be demonstrating here illustrates the "Bronze-Silver-Gold" paradigm which is a best practice for data lakes.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - We ingest data as soon as we can into the lake, even though we know it may need cleansing or enrichment.  This gives us a baseline of the freshest possible data for exploration.  We call this the __Bronze__ version of the data.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - We then cleanse and enrich the Bronze data, creating a "single version of truth" that we call the __Silver__ version.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - From the Silver data, we can generate many __Gold__ versions of the data.  Gold versions are typically project-specific, and typically filter, aggregate, and re-format Silver data to make it easy to use in specific projects.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We'll read the raw data into a __Dataframe__.  The dataframe is a key structure in Apache Spark.  It is an in-memory data structure in a rows-and-columns format that is very similar to a relational database table.  In fact, we'll be creating SQL Views against the dataframes so that we can manipulate them using standard SQL.

# COMMAND ----------

# Read the downloaded historical data into a dataframe
# This is MegaCorp data regarding power plant device performance.  It pre-dates our new IOT effort, but we want to save this data and use it in queries.

dataPath = f"dbfs:/FileStore/flight/{team_name}/assignment_1_ingest.csv"

df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").option("inferSchema", "true").load(dataPath)
#
# TO DO - Read the data from dataPath into a dataframe
# NOTES:
# - The input data is in CSV format
# - The input data contains a header row with column names
# - You can let Spark infer the schema
#

#
# END OF TO DO
#

display(df)

# COMMAND ----------

# This API call is totally awesome, because it lets us use spark.sql() or run %SQL cells!

df.createOrReplaceTempView("tmp")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC SELECT DISTINCT device_operational_status-- TO DO... Select all the distinct values from the device_operational_status column
# MAGIC FROM tmp

# COMMAND ----------

# Read the downloaded backfill data into a dataframe
# This is some backfill data that we'll need to merge into the main historical data.  

dataPath = f"dbfs:/FileStore/flight/{team_name}/assignment_1_backfill.csv"

df_backfill = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load(dataPath)
#
# TO DO - Read the data from dataPath into a dataframe
# NOTES:
# - The input data is in CSV format
# - The input data contains a header row with column names
# - You can let Spark infer the schema
#

#
# END OF TO DO
#

display(df_backfill)

# COMMAND ----------

# Create a temporary view on the dataframes to enable SQL

df.createOrReplaceTempView("historical_bronze_vw")
df_backfill.createOrReplaceTempView("historical_bronze_backfill_vw")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Create Bronze Historical Tables
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __NOTE TO FLIGHT SCHOOL STUDENTS...__ We're adding this graphic-heavy markdown cell just to demonstrate the kinds of markdown you might want to use in your own demos.  It's nice to put these graphics into your demo notebook, because then you don't have to flip back and forth between your notebook and your PowerPoint slides during a demo.

# MAGIC #### Databricks' Delta Lake is the world's most advanced data lake technology.  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Delta Lake brings __*Performance*__ and __*Reliability*__ to Data Lakes
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Why did Delta Lake have to be invented?  Let's take a look...
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/billkellett/flight-school-resources/blob/master/images/projects_failing.png?raw=true" width=1000/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As the graphic above shows, Big Data Lake projects have a very high failure rate.  In fact, Gartner Group estimates that 85% of these projects fail (see https://www.infoworld.com/article/3393467/4-reasons-big-data-projects-failand-4-ways-to-succeed.html ).  *Why* is the failure rate so high?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/billkellett/flight-school-resources/blob/master/images/projects_failing_reasons.png?raw=true" width=1000/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The graphic above shows the main __*reliability*__ issues with data lakes.  Unlike relational databases, typical data lakes are not capable of transactional (ACID) behavior.  This leads to a number of reliability issues:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - When a job fails, incomplete work is not rolled back, as it would be in a relational database.  Data may be left in an inconsistent state.  This issue is extremely difficult to deal with in production.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Data lakes typically cannot enforce schema.  This is often touted as a "feature" called "schema-on-read," because it allows flexibility at data ingest time.  However, when downstream jobs fail trying to read corrupt data, we have a very difficult recovery problem.  It is often difficult just to find the source application that caused the problem... which makes fixing the problem even harder!
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Relational databases allow multiple concurrent users, and ensure that each user gets a consistent view of data.  Half-completed transactions never show up in the result sets of other concurrent users.  This is not true in a typical data lake.  Therefore, it is almost impossible to have a concurrent mix of read jobs and write jobs.  This becomes an even bigger problem with streaming data, because streams typically don't pause to let other jobs run!
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Next, let's look at the key __*performance issues*__ with data lakes...
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/billkellett/flight-school-resources/blob/master/images/projects_failing_reasons_1.png?raw=true" width=1000/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - We have already noted that data lakes cannot provide a consistent view of data to concurrent users.  This is a reliability problem, but it is also a __*performance*__ problem because if we must run jobs one at a time, our production time window becomes extremely limited.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Most data lake engineers have come face-to-face with the "small-file problem."  Data is typically ingested into a data lake in batches.  Each batch typically becomes a separate physical file in a directory that defines a table in the lake.  Over time, the number of physical files can grow to be very large.  When this happens, performance suffers because opening and closing these files is a time-consuming operation.  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Experienced relational database architects may be surprised to learn that Big Data usually cannot be indexed in the same way as relational databases.  The indexes become too large to be manageable and performant.  Instead, we "partition" data by putting it into sub-directories.  Each partition can represent a column (or a composite set of columns) in the table.  This lets us avoid scanning the entire data set... *if* our queries are based on the partition column.  However, in the real world, analysts are running a wide range of queries which may or may not be based on the partition column.  In these scenarios, there is no benefit to partitioning.  In addition, partitioning breaks down if we choose a partition column with extremely high cardinality.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Data lakes typically live in cloud storage (e.g., S3 on AWS, ADLS on Azure), and these storage devices are quite slow compared to SSD disk drives.  Most data lakes have no capability to cache data on faster devices, and this fact has a major impact on performance.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __*Delta Lake was built to solve these reliability and performance problems.*__  First, let's consider how Delta Lake addresses *reliability* issues...
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/billkellett/flight-school-resources/blob/master/images/delta_reliability.png?raw=true" width=1000/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Note the Key Features in the graphic above.  We'll be diving into all of these capabilities as we go through the Workshop:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __ACID Transactions:__ Delta Lake ACID compliance ensures that half-completed transactions are never persisted in the Lake, and concurrent users never see other users' in-flight transactions.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Mutations:__ Experienced relational database architects may be surprised to learn that most data lakes do not support updates and deletes.  These lakes concern themselves only with data ingest, which makes error correction and backfill very difficult.  In contrast, Delta Lake provides full support for Inserts, Updates, and Deletes.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Schema Enforcement:__ Delta Lake provides full support for schema enforcement at write time, greatly increasing data reliability.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Unified Batch and Streaming:__ Streaming data is becoming an essential capability for all enterprises.  We'll see how Delta Lake supports both batch and streaming modes, and in fact blurs the line between them, enabling architects to design systems that use both batch and streaming capabilities simultaneously.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Time Travel:__ unlike most data lakes, Delta Lake enables queries of data *as it existed* at a specific point in time.  This has important ramifications for reliability, error recovery, and synchronization with other systems, as we shall see later in this Workshop.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We have seen how Delta Lake enhances reliability.  Next, let's see how Delta Lake optimizes __*performance*__...
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/billkellett/flight-school-resources/blob/master/images/delta_performance.png?raw=true" width=1000/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Again, we'll be diving into all these capabilities throughout the Workshop.  We'll be concentrating especially on features that are only available in Databricks' distribution of Delta Lake...
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Compaction:__ Delta Lake provides sophisticated capabilities to solve the "small-file problem" by compacting small files into larger units.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Caching:__ Delta Lake transparently caches data on the SSD drives of worker nodes in a Spark cluster, greatly improving performance.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Data Skipping:__ this Delta Lake feature goes far beyond the limits of mere partitioning.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Z-Ordering:__ this is a brilliant alternative to traditional indexing, and further enhances Delta Lake performance.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Now that we have introduced the value proposition of Delta Lake, let's get a deeper understanding of the overall "Data Lake" concept.
